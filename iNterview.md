Below is a **structured, interview-oriented topic checklist** tailored specifically for the **Associate Software Engineer – MERN** role described in the email. This is aligned with **fresh graduate / ≤6 months experience expectations** and reflects what interviewers typically probe at this level.

---

## 1. JavaScript Fundamentals (Core Priority)

You must be very strong here, as MERN interviews heavily rely on JS fundamentals.

### Language Basics

* `var`, `let`, `const` (scope & hoisting)
* Data types (primitive vs reference)
* Type coercion & equality (`==` vs `===`)
* Truthy / falsy values

### Functions & Execution

* Function declaration vs expression
* Arrow functions
* Callbacks
* Closures (very important)
* `this` keyword
* Execution context & call stack
* Event loop (call stack, callback queue, microtasks)

### ES6+ Features

* Destructuring
* Spread & rest operators
* Template literals
* Modules (`import` / `export`)
* Default parameters
* Optional chaining

### Asynchronous JavaScript

* Promises
* `async / await`
* Error handling (`try/catch`)
* Fetch vs Axios

---

## 2. React.js (Frontend – High Priority)

### Core Concepts

* What React is & why it’s used
* JSX
* Components (functional vs class – focus on functional)
* Props vs State
* Component re-rendering

### Hooks (Must Know)

* `useState`
* `useEffect`
* Dependency array behavior
* Cleanup functions
* `useContext`
* `useRef` (basic understanding)

### React Patterns

* Controlled vs uncontrolled components
* Lifting state up
* Conditional rendering
* Lists & keys
* Form handling

### Routing & API Integration

* React Router (`BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, `useParams`, `useNavigate`)
* API integration using Axios
* Loading & error states

### Performance & Best Practices (Basic)

* Avoid unnecessary re-renders
* Component reuse
* Folder structure
* Environment variables

---

## 3. Node.js & Express.js (Backend – High Priority)

### Node.js Basics

* What Node.js is
* Event-driven architecture
* Non-blocking I/O
* NPM basics

### Express.js

* Creating an Express server
* Routing (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
* Middleware (custom & built-in)
* Request lifecycle
* Error-handling middleware

### REST APIs

* REST principles
* Request/response cycle
* HTTP status codes
* API versioning (basic)

### Authentication (Basic)

* JWT (what it is & flow)
* Password hashing (bcrypt)
* Login vs signup flow

---

## 4. MongoDB & Databases (Very Important)

### MongoDB (NoSQL)

* Collections & documents
* ObjectId
* CRUD operations
* Mongoose schemas & models
* Validation
* Relationships (`ref`, `populate`)
* Indexes (basic understanding)

### SQL Basics (Theory Level)

* Tables, rows, columns
* Primary key vs foreign key
* `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
* `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
* Basic `JOIN` understanding

### SQL vs NoSQL

* Use cases
* Schema flexibility
* Scalability

---

## 5. Object-Oriented Programming (Must Be Clear)

### Core Concepts

* Classes & objects
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction



1. Is JavaScript fully OOP?
No, it’s prototype-based, not purely class-based.

2. Can you achieve encapsulation in JavaScript?
Yes, using closures and access control.

3. Is inheritance always good?
No, overuse leads to tight coupling; composition is often better.

4. Difference between abstraction and encapsulation?
Abstraction hides complexity; encapsulation restricts access.

5. Can we have polymorphism without inheritance?
Yes, through method overriding or interfaces-like behavior.

6. Are classes mandatory for OOP in JS?
No, objects and prototypes are sufficient.

7. Why prefer composition over inheritance?
More flexible and easier to maintain.

8. Does OOP mean stateful only?
Mostly yes, but good design minimizes unnecessary state.

Final Interview One-Liner

“OOP structures code around objects and state, while functional programming focuses on pure functions and immutability; modern JavaScript often uses a mix of both.”

### Practical Understanding

* OOP in JavaScript
* Constructor functions
* Prototypes
* ES6 classes

### Design Thinking

* When to use OOP
* Benefits in large-scale applications

## 6. Data Structures & Algorithms (Basic Level)

### Data Structures

* Arrays
* Strings
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Hash Maps (Objects / Maps)

### Algorithms

* Linear search
* Binary search (concept)
* Sorting basics (bubble, selection – concept only)
* Time & space complexity (Big-O basics)

### Problem Solving

* Reverse string
* Palindrome check
* Frequency counting
* Two-sum type problems
* Basic recursion

---

## 7. Git & Version Control (Essential)

### Git Basics

* `git init`
* `git clone`
* `git status`
* `git add`
* `git commit`
* `git push`
* `git pull`

### Branching

* `git branch`
* `git checkout`
* Merge vs rebase (basic concept)
* Handling merge conflicts

### GitHub

* Repositories
* Pull requests
* `.gitignore`

---

## 8. Software Development Best Practices

* Clean code principles
* Naming conventions
* Code readability
* DRY principle
* Separation of concerns
* Environment configuration
* Error handling & logging
* Basic testing concepts (unit vs integration)

---

## 9. Debugging & Optimization

* Reading stack traces
* Console debugging
* Backend error handling (500, 404, 401)
* Frontend error boundaries (basic idea)
* Network tab usage
* API response debugging

---

## 10. Projects Discussion (Very Important)

Be prepared to explain:

* Project architecture (frontend ↔ backend)
* Tech stack used
* Database schema
* API flow
* Authentication logic
* Challenges faced
* How you debugged issues
* What you would improve if given time

---

## 11. Soft Skills Preparation

* Explaining technical concepts clearly
* Thinking aloud during problem-solving
* Asking clarifying questions
* Handling feedback
* Team collaboration examples
* Learning mindset examples

---

## Interview Reality Check

Given your recent work with **React, Express, MongoDB, authentication, carts, orders, and APIs**, you are already covering **60–70%** of what they expect. The main focus should be **strengthening fundamentals and articulation**, not learning advanced topics.

---

If you want, I can:

* Convert this into a **7–10 day preparation plan**
* Provide **MERN-focused interview questions with answers**
* Conduct **mock technical interviews**
* Create a **project explanation script** tailored to your CV

Just say the word.
